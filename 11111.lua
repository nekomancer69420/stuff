Are you a LuaU maestro? Want to put your skills to the test?
The following are 2 print statements, with each having 16 "elements".
print(#{2, debug.info(2, "C"), nil, nil, 999, nil, nil, 5, tostring(5), 999, 2, "hi", nil, function(abc, aa) return "free krampsz key plz" end, czzz==b, nil})
print(#{"abc", 1, warn, 423, nil, setmetatable({}, {__index = function() end}), nil, 5, nil, nil, nil, g==f, a==bne, function(r, re, Q) end, nil, nil})
Outputs are:
1 12
2 4

Now, why do they each not print 16 and why do they differ so much even though they both have 16 "elements"?
